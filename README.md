# Programming Mindset in the Real World

## Looking Back

Over the last section of lessons, we explored how to develop a programmer's
mindset. Specifically, we covered:

- What makes an effective programmer
- What a programmer's mindset looks like
- The Flatiron Programming Process
- How to ask questions
- Strategies for getting unstuck
- Pseudocoding
- Validating pseudocode
- How to post issues to the community

These are all fairly large concepts and processes, so remember that they might
take some practice to integrate them into your regular workflow. Refer back when
you need to, especially when you're beginning a new project or feeling stuck in
a current project.

## Looking Ahead

As you learn more about code, you'll see that it's not just about syntax and
structure. It's also about problem solving. Being able to reason your way
through the problems code is meant to solve is a fundamental skill for a coder.
As you work your way through lessons about Ruby, JavaScript or HTML, always
remember to take a step back, gain perspective and flex your problem solving
muscles.
